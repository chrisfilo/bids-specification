# Introduction

## Motivation

Neuroimaging experiments result in complicated data that can be arranged in many
different ways. So far there is no consensus how to organize and share data
obtained in neuroimaging experiments. Even two researchers working in the same
lab can opt to arrange their data in a different way. Lack of consensus (or a
standard) leads to misunderstandings and time wasted on rearranging data or
rewriting scripts expecting certain structure. Here we describe a simple and
easy-to-adopt way of organising neuroimaging and behavioural data. By using this
standard you will benefit in the following ways:

- It will be easy for another researcher to work on your data. To understand the
  organisation of the files and their format you will only need to refer them to
  this document. This is especially important if you are running your own lab
  and anticipate more than one person working on the same data over time. By
  using BIDS you will save time trying to understand and reuse data acquired by
  a graduate student or postdoc that has already left the lab.
- There are a growing number of data analysis software packages that can
  understand data organised according to BIDS (see
  <http://bids.neuroimaging.io> for the most up to date list).
- Databases such as OpenNeuro.org accept datasets organised according to BIDS.
  If you ever plan to share your data publicly (nowadays some journals require
  this) you can minimize the additional time and energy spent on publication,
  and speed up the curation process by using BIDS to structure and describe your
  data right after acquisition.
- There are [validation tools](https://github.com/Squishymedia/BIDS-Validator)
  that can check your dataset integrity and let you easily spot missing values.

BIDS is heavily inspired by the format used internally by OpenfMRI.org and has
been supported by the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility and
the Neuroimaging Data Sharing Task Force. While working on BIDS we consulted
many neuroscientists to make sure it covers most common experiments, but at the
same time is intuitive and easy to adopt. The specification is intentionally
based on simple file formats and folder structures to reflect current lab
practices and make it accessible to a wide range of scientists coming from
different backgrounds.

## Definitions

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in \[[RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)].

Throughout this protocol we use a list of terms. To avoid misunderstanding we
clarify them here.

1. Dataset - a set of neuroimaging and behavioural data acquired for a purpose
   of a particular study. A dataset consists of data acquired from one or more
   subjects, possibly from multiple sessions.
2. Subject - a person or animal participating in the study.
3. Session - a logical grouping of neuroimaging and behavioural data consistent
   across subjects. Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit
   in a longitudinal study. In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during
   one session. However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room
   and then be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions
   will still be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other
   subjects. Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained
   over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day
   after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple sessions is
   appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions are planned
   and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of some
   intervention between sessions (e.g., training).
4. Data acquisition - a continuous uninterrupted block of time during which a
   brain scanning instrument was acquiring data according to particular scanning
   sequence/protocol.
5. Data type - a functional group of different types of data. In BIDS we define
   five data types: func (task based and resting state functional MRI), dwi
   (diffusion weighted imaging), fmap (field inhomogeneity mapping data such as
   field maps), anat (structural imaging such as T1, T2, etc.), meg
   (magnetoencephalography).
6. Task - a set of structured activities performed by the participant. Tasks are
   usually accompanied by stimuli and responses, and can greatly vary in
   complexity. For the purpose of this protocol we consider the so-called
   “resting state” a task. In the context of brain scanning, a task is always
   tied to one data acquisition. Therefore, even if during one acquisition the
   subject performed multiple conceptually different behaviours (with different
   sets of instructions) they will be considered one (combined) task.
7. Event - a stimulus or subject response recorded during a task. Each event has
   an onset time and duration. Note that not all tasks will have recorded events
   (e.g., resting state).
8. Run - an uninterrupted repetition of data acquisition that has the same
   acquisition parameters and task (however events can change from run to run
   due to different subject response or randomized nature of the stimuli). Run
   is a synonym of a data acquisition.

## Compulsory, optional, and additional data and metadata

The following standard describes a way of arranging data and writing down
metadata for a subset of neuroimaging experiments. Some aspects of the standard
are compulsory. For example a particular file name format is required when
storing structural scans. Some aspects are regulated but optional. For example a
T2 volume does not need to be included, but when it is available it should be
saved under a particular file name specified in the standard. This standard
aspires to describe a majority of datasets, but acknowledges that there will be
cases that do not fit. In such cases one can include additional files and
subfolders to the existing folder structure following common sense. For example
one may want to include eye tracking data in a vendor specific format that is
not covered by this standard. The most sensible place to put it is next to the
continuous recording file with the same naming scheme but different extensions.
The solutions will change from case to case and publicly available datasets will
be reviewed to include common data types in the future releases of the BIDS
spec.

## Source vs. raw vs. derived data

BIDS in its current form is designed to harmonize and describe raw (unprocessed
or minimally processed due to file format conversion) data. During analysis such
data will be transformed and partial as well as final results will be saved.
Derivatives of the raw data (other than products of DICOM to NIfTI conversion)
MUST be kept separate from the raw data. This way one can protect the raw data
from accidental changes by file permissions. In addition it is easy to
distinguish partial results from the raw data and share the latter. Similar
rules apply to source data which is defined as data before harmonization and/or
file format conversion (for example E-Prime event logs or DICOM files).

This specification currently does not go into details of recommending a
particular naming scheme for including different types of source data (raw event
logs, parameter files, etc. before conversion to BIDS) and data derivatives
(correlation maps, brain masks, contrasts maps, etc.). However, in the case that
these data are to be included:

1. These data MUST be kept in separate `sourcedata` and `derivatives` folders
    each with a similar folder structure as presented below for the BIDS-managed
    data. For example:
    `derivatives/fmriprep/sub-01/ses-pre/sub-01_ses-pre_mask.nii.gz` or
    `sourcedata/sub-01/ses-pre/func/sub-01_ses-pre_task-rest_bold.dicom.tgz` or
    `sourcedata/sub-01/ses-pre/func/MyEvent.sce`.
2. A README file SHOULD be found at the root of the `sourcedata` or the
    `derivatives` folder (or both). This file should describe the nature of the
    raw data or the derived data. In the case of the existence of a
    `derivatives` folder, we RECOMMEND including details about the software
    stack and settings used to generate the results. Inclusion of non-imaging
    objects that improve reproducibility are encouraged (scripts, settings
    files, etc.).
3. We RECOMMEND including the PDF print-out with the actual sequence parameters
    generated by the scanner in the `sourcedata` folder.

## The Inheritance Principle

Any metadata file (`.json`, `.bvec`, `.tsv`, etc.) may be defined at any
directory level, but no more than one applicable file may be defined at a given
level (Example 1). The values from the top level are inherited by all lower
levels unless they are overridden by a file at the lower level. For example,
`sub-*_task-rest_bold.json` may be specified at the participant level, setting
TR to a specific value. If one of the runs has a different TR than the one
specified in that file, another `sub-*_task-rest_bold.json` file can be placed
within that specific series directory specifying the TR for that specific run.
There is no notion of "unsetting" a key/value pair. For example if there is a
JSON file corresponding to particular participant/run defining a key/value and
there is a JSON file on the root level of the dataset that does not define this
key/value it will not be "unset" for all subjects/runs. Files for a particular
participant can exist only at participant level directory, i.e
`/dataset/sub-*[/ses-*]/sub-*_T1w.json`. Similarly, any file that is not
specific to a participant is to be declared only at top level of dataset for eg:
`task-sist_bold.json` must be placed under `/dataset/task-sist_bold.json`

Example 1: Two JSON files at same level that are applicable for NIfTI file.

    sub-01/
        ses-test/
            sub-test_task-overtverbgeneration_bold.json
            sub-test_task-overtverbgeneration_run-2_bold.json
            anat/
                sub-01_ses-test_T1w.nii.gz
            func/
                sub-01_ses-test_task-overtverbgeneration_run-1_bold.nii.gz
                sub-01_ses-test_task-overtverbgeneration_run-2_bold.nii.gz

In the above example, two JSON files are listed under `sub-01/ses-test/`, which
are each applicable to
`sub-01_ses-test_task-overtverbgeneration_run-2_bold.nii.gz`, violating the
constraint that no more than one file may be defined at a given level of the
directory structure. Instead `task-overtverbgeneration_run-2_bold.json` should
have been under `sub-01/ses-test/func/`.

Example 2: Multiple run and rec with same acquisition (acq) parameters acq-test1

    sub-01/
        anat/
        func/
            sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_run-1_bold.nii.gz
            sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_run-2_bold.nii.gz
            sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_rec-recon1_bold.nii.gz
            sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_rec-recon2_bold.nii.gz
            sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_bold.json

For the above example, all NIfTI files are acquired with same scanning
parameters (`acq-test1`). Hence a JSON file describing the acq parameters will
apply to different runs and rec files. Also if the JSON file
(`task-xyz_acq-test1_bold.json`) is defined at dataset top level directory, it
will be applicable to all task runs with `test1` acquisition parameter.

Case 2: Multiple json files at different levels for same task and acquisition
parameters

    sub-01/
       sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_bold.json
             anat/
             func/
                 sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_run-1_bold.nii.gz
                 sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_rec-recon1_bold.nii.gz
                 sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_rec-recon2_bold.nii.gz

In the above example, the fields from `task-xyz_acq-test1_bold.json` file will
apply to all bold runs. However, if there is a key with different value in
`sub-01/func/sub-01_task-xyz_acq-test1_run-1_bold.json`, the new value will be
applicable for that particular run/task NIfTI file/s.

## Extensions

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will
evolve over time. A number of extensions are currently being worked on:
